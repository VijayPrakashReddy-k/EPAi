### 1. Versions :

  *` As of Janurary 1, 2020, Python has officially dropped support for python2. And to check Python version at the command line by running command`*
  
   **python --version**
   
### 2. Basic data types :
  
  *`Like most languages, Python has a number of basic types including integers, floats, booleans, and strings. These data types behave in ways that are familiar from other programming languages.`*

**` i. Numbers:`** Integers and floats work as you would expect from other languages:
<ul>
<li>Note that unlike many languages, Python does not have unary increment (x++) or decrement (x--) operators.

<li>Python also has built-in types for complex numbers & can find all of the details here,
  [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex)
  

**` ii. Booleans:`** Python implements all of the usual operators for Boolean logic, but uses English words rather than symbols (&&, ||, etc.)

**` iii. Strings:`**  Python has great support for strings and here is the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)
