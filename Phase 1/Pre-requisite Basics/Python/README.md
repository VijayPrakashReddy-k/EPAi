## Python

- `Guido van Rossum` designed the Python and first appeared in 1990. And python is allowed with extensions `".py",".pyi",".pyc",".pyd"`. Python supports four main programming paradigms: *imperative, functional, procedural, and object-oriented.*

<ol>
 <li> Imperative programming paradigm :
    The imperative programming paradigm uses the imperative mood of natural language to express directions. It executes commands in a step-by-step manner, just like a series of verbal commands. Following the "how-to-solve" approach, it makes direct changes to the state of the program; hence it is also called the "stateful programming model."
  
<br>
  
 <li> Functional programming paradigm :
    The functional programming paradigm treats program computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions based on "lambda calculus". Lambda calculus is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. It follows the "what-to-solve" approach—that is, "it expresses logic without describing its control flow—hence it is also classified as the declarative programming model".
 
   `The functional programming implementation of this paradigm is fascinating, as it reduces the lines of code and simply does its job in a single line, with the exception of using the functools module and the reduce method. The three keywords — functools, reduce, and lambda.`

<li> Procedural programming paradigm :
    The procedural programming paradigm is a subtype of imperative programming in which statements are structured into procedures (also known as subroutines or functions). The program composition is more of a procedure call where the programs might reside somewhere in the universe and the execution is sequential, thus becoming a bottleneck for resource utilization. Like the imperative programming paradigm, procedural programming follows the stateful model. The procedural programming paradigm facilitates the practice of good program design and allows modules to be reused in the form of code libraries.
 
 <br>
 
<li> Object-oriented programming paradigm : 
    The object-oriented programming paradigm considers basic entities as objects whose instance can contain both data and the corresponding methods to modify that data. The different principles of object-oriented design help code reusability, data hiding, etc.,
  
### 1. Versions :

  *` As of Janurary 1, 2020, Python has officially dropped support for python2. And to check Python version at the command line by running command`*
  
   **python --version**
   
### 2. Basic data types :
  
  *`Like most languages, Python has a number of basic types including integers, floats, booleans, and strings. These data types behave in ways that are familiar from other programming languages.`*

**` i. Numbers:`** Integers and floats work as you would expect from other languages:
<ul>
<li>Note that unlike many languages, Python does not have unary increment (x++) or decrement (x--) operators.

<li>Python also has built-in types for complex numbers & can find all of the details here,
  [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex)
  

**` ii. Booleans:`** Python implements all of the usual operators for Boolean logic, but uses English words rather than symbols (&&, ||, etc.)

**` iii. Strings:`**  Python has great support for strings and here is the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)
